# Python_maze

The main part of this maze program was taken from https://github.com/illiterati1/python_maze. 
We included an A* solving strategy into it, solving the maze heuristic based. 
See https://github.com/illiterati1/python_maze/blob/master/README.md for more information of the maze program itself.

## BUT HOW DO I GET IT STARTED?

Dowload or clone this repository and open it in a python interpreter (python 2.7). Type maze.py to start for the maze file in the RUN folder. The rest will be self-explainatory.

## BUT MY HEURISTIC IS BETTER THAN YOURS!

Are you sure? Just change the implementation of the heuristic in the A* file and see what happens.

## BUT HOW DO I PROVE THAT MY HEURISTIC IS BETTER THAN YOURS?

Go to the COMPARE folder, put your heuristic there aswell and start the maze by maze.py. You will get the average performance of A* with your heuristic.

Have fun!
